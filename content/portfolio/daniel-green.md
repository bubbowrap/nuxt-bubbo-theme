## Project Details

Elan Polo wanted to update and upgrade their online stores to be mobile responsive, so they contacted NetSource Technologies. Their internal team provided the desktop design mockups, and I turned their designs into working code. I mirrored it as closely as I could while also figuring out how the design would look and function on mobile devices. This project was slightly more complicated because it’s actually three different (but similar) sites using the same ProductCart database; we managed this by having a theme switcher that changed the CSS/homepage design depending on which domain the user was visiting from.

This site was built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Twitter Bootstrap**, and **jQuery/javascript** on top of the ProductCart E-commerce system.
